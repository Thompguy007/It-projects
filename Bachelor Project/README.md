Abstract:
This project investigates the impact of generative AI on the production and quality of visual content and how it shapes our understanding of media, as well as our ability to distinguish between authentic and AI-generated content. The study uses McLuhan's communication theory, specifically his concepts of “the medium is the message” and “hot and cold media,” to analyze how generative AI affects media understanding and the authenticity of content. The TRIN model is used to examine the design and functions of the technology, as well as its unforeseen consequences.

Key findings include the rapid development of generative AI in both production and quality, which challenges the ability to distinguish generated images from authentic ones. The study also highlights the potential for generative AI to create distrust and false content in the media. A survey was conducted to measure the influence of generative AI on daily life and the ability to distinguish between real and AI-generated content, revealing that identifying AI-generated images is challenging. Interviews with participants provided insights into their perceptions and concerns about generative AI in the media. The project concludes that generative AI affects media perception and increases concerns about media distrust, emphasizing the need for better methods and tools to identify AI-generated content to maintain public trust in the media.
